# Header 1

This is some very basic text.

## Header 2

This is some other text in a sub-heading. You can go on until level 6.

Newlines are interpreted as new paragraphs.

I can emphasize text like *this* or like **this**.

Unordered lists are created with symbols like *, -, +... but the first item of the list needs to be preceded by an empty line:

* I like cooking
+ I also like languages
- and I like folk music
    - especially Blackbeard's Tea Party!
    
Ordered lists are created with numbers and dots. Even if you mess up the numbering, MD will fix it for you:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
2. Item 3
    
Links can be added in text like this: [click here](http://www.blackbeardsteaparty.com/) or like this: <http://www.blackbeardsteaparty.com/>

Images are basically links, but they have to be also separated from the main text by an empty line before and after:

![A super fluffy cat](images/fluffycat.jpg)

![Kitty and bunny](images/catbunny.jpg)

Tables can be written with -- and || symbols:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
